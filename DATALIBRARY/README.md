DATALIBRARY

This is a simple backend app that allows me to use the 
casual node module and can allow the user to choose specific categories of 
data to randomly be generated.

The user can also specify the number of records to be created AND the name 
of the file which will be saved as a .csv file.

TODO: make so file is saved ore specifically as opposed to a local file inside app directory.
